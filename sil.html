            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>During HBL/Whenever I am free, I have decided to practice web development by first thinking of a project and followed by working towards completing it. If I had problems, I would search online for answers or continuously try. I decided to take this passion up as I prefer creating something interactive which can be easily displayed or shared such as via a website. Here are some projects I have made..</p>
