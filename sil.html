            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>During HBL/Whenever I am free, I have decided to practice web development by first thinking of a project and followed by working towards completing it. If I had problems, I would search online for answers or continuously try. I decided to take this passion up as I prefer creating something interactive which can be easily displayed or shared such as via a website.</p>
            <p>Last year, I followed a website called FreeCodeCamp which guided me on making websites such as a survey.</p>
            <p>However, this year, I decided to not follow the website's tutorials and try to make some projects myself.</p>
            <p>Some projects I made by myself this year includes..</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Calculator (<a target="_blank" href="https://lohputter.github.io/calculator/">https://lohputter.github.io/calculator/</a>)
                    <img src="calculator.png">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Text Animation Website (<a target="_blank" href="https://lohputter.github.io/namer/">https://lohputter.github.io/namer/</a>)

                </li>
                <li>This E-Portfolio</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope to be able to continue pursuing this interest of mine, using more advanced programming languages and building bigger and better projects. </p>

            <h1>Story Writing</h1>
            <p>Lately, I have gained an interest in writing fictional stories and would set aside some time to plan and work on a story. I already have ideas for characters and the plot but I just need to write it out on Google Docs.</p>
            <img src="story.png">
            <p>It is still a work in progress. My English is not the best in terms of vocabulary but I am still trying to at least write out something decent and continue to work hard towards it.</p>
